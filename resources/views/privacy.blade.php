(&quot;Net It Ltd.&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information (&quot;Personal Information&quot;) you (&quot;User&quot;, &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) may provide on the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://freelancersincubator.com">freelancersincubator.com</a> website and any of its products or services (collectively, &quot;Website&quot; or &quot;Services&quot;).

                    <p>You are able to access, add to, update and delete certain Personal Information about you. The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Website or Services change.

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below.
